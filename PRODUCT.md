# Product

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

web

## Stack

React + TypeScript + Vite, plain CSS with design tokens. Chosen by the project brief (Interval 1).

## Users

Players who want a calm, personal game they can open in a browser tab and spend a few unhurried minutes in. They play solo, often on a laptop or phone, with no account. They come back to *their* kitchen, which is named by them.

## Product Purpose

A cozy baking game about discovering recipes by experimenting with ingredients, collecting what you make, keeping a recipe book, and making a kitchen your own. Success is a player who feels the kitchen is theirs and wants to come back to see what else they can make.

## Positioning

Not an idle or clicker game: nothing accumulates while you're away, and there are no numbers to grind. Progress is what you've discovered and made. The interface is the kitchen itself (counter, recipe box, jars, index cards), not a dashboard around a game.

## Constraints

- Works without an account; saves stay in the browser (IndexedDB).
- A save is never discarded without the player's explicit say-so.
- No fake content: an unfinished area says it's unfinished.
- Accessible from the start: keyboard, screen readers, contrast, reduced motion.
- Keep dependencies minimal.

## Voice

Warm, plain, a little playful, never cutesy. Short sentences, written like a note left on the counter. Controls say what they do ("Open the kitchen", "Keep my kitchen"). Errors say what happened and what's safe.

## Open decisions

- Whether names can be changed after setup.
- Audio direction (the sound setting is stored but nothing plays yet).
